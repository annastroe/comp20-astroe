COMP 20 Spring 2016 Private Repo for Anna Stroe

    The purpose of this git repository is to display and store the labs and projects I completed in COMP20 Spring Semester 2016. 
  These assignments showcase the breadth of topics covered in the course and the implementations of these topics into 
  real world scenarios, such as storing user and landmark locations, and building an online portfolio.
    My favorite assignment in this course was Assignment 1, creating a biography, home page, and resume, because I enjoyed
  both the front end development and design aspects of the project, as well as the usability of this code/site in future endeavors.
    Throughout the course, I have grown more motivated to take on personal projects and learn independently. This has 
  allowed me to structure the assignments in a way that worked best for me, and to be creative with the implementations
  and features I included. 
    The most important thing I learned in this course is definitely to learn independently and take accountability for 
  my own learning and capabilities. I feel that this is particularly important for a course like Web Programming,
  where the methods, regulations, and technology is constantly adapting, and therefore necessitates consistent 
  improvement and learning. An example of this was in our projects, where we received the necessary background in 
  lecture and reading, but weren't given specific instructions (outside of the assignment guidelines), so we 
  were responsible for figuring out the structure and overall functioning of our work. Another example of this is 
  the atypical structure of lectures in the course. Instead of the typical lectures that are later uploaded online,
  the lectures required much more interaction from student and therefore it was our responsibility to get as much
  out of the lectures as we wanted to.
    I would love to delve deeper into front end development and user interaction with websites (how to make your code
  adaptable and flexible for the user).
