		Introduction
		</div> <br> 

		In this assessment I test the security of The Server and Client Side Web Application for Historic Landmarks, Assignment 2 and 3, 
		which create a database and rendering of the nearest historical landmark within a mile of a given user. While the web application
		does currently function properly, it contains a number of issues in its security that could compromise its function. 
		In this assessment, I will outline these security issues, as well as the methods I used to locate them, and the details and locations
		of the specific issues. Thereafter, I will provide recommendations for improving these security measures.

		Methodology
		</div> <br>

		I first used the "black-box" method of testing, where I did not look through her code to find issues, but rather tested the site on the
		user side to locate any vulnerabilities, posting logins and manipulating the URL query strings.  
		I then utilized the "white-box" method of testing, wherein I traced through her code to locate any specific issues and security bugs,
		to see where she might fix the issues found through black-box testing.

		Abstract of Findings
		</div> <br> 

		One issue was with cross-site scripting when sending locations to the server. The application does not remove 
		the ability for data to be interpreted as code, which means that one can send script in as data, and alter 
		the function and look of the website. This issue was found through black box testing. 

		<br> 
		
		Also using the black-box method, I tried entering /checkins.json?login[$ne]=abc in her URL, to see if it would return 
		all of her logins (that weren't "abc"), which it indeed did. This is a request injection attack, which leads to obvious
		privacy issues, as you can get access to all the logins on the web application.

		<br> 

		Another issue was that I was able to insert HTML into the site through a curl login entry. This is similar to the 
		first cross site scripting issue, in that the application does not check for code/ non-alphanumeric login information.

 		Issues Found
 		</div> <br>
		Cross Site Scripting (entering an alert) - high risk
		<br>

		To locate this issue, I used curl, sending locations with a script tag with an alert message to see if it would pop up when I opened the heroku app 
		(which I was added as a collaborator to). 
		<br>

		<br>
		This is an issue because the application does not prevent the user input from being read in as javascript, thus altering the site 
		and creating this popup window. This is of high risk because it could completely compromise the functionality of the site.


		<br>
		<br>
		Request Injection Attack - moderate

		To locate this issue, I entered "login[$ne]=abc" in the checkins.json query. This allowed my to view all the logins to the site (that weren't
		"abc").
